* People who are curious about your skills

**The Parts to Your Portfolio & Must Haves:**

* Initial page that pulls reader in for more information, create a tease so they want more
* About page: Headshot, short description (brand statement + a bit more), should be clear who you are and what you do

## Project Best Practices:
Projects are a great way to showcase your your skills in a way that that your user can see how you actually put the skills you learned to action.  With each project, think about how you can convey your talents, your skills, your role, and the impact/result of the scenario.  Here are some general best practices!  


When writing about your project, here are some questions to keep in mind. 
* What question are you looking to answer?
* Why does this question matter?
* What research did you do?
* Where did you get the research materials?
* How will the research/project be utilized?
* How did you explore the research/project?
* How did you model the research/project?
* Why did you choose to structure the project the way you did?
* What code did you write / use?
* How did you compile the project?
* How did you know the results/project would make sense?
* How did you visualize the results/project?
* How you would communicate the results/project to others?
* What did you learn?
* What you would do differently if you did this project again?
* If you were going to continue this work, what next steps would you take with this project?
* How you would explain what you did to a technical audience?
* How you would explain what you did to a non-technical audience?

## GA Profiles:

We’ll walk you through best practices in creating your GA profile. It is handy to have your updated resume handy.

## You do: 

Create your draft GA Profile.  You will need to use the email address that you signed up for GA with to access GA Profiles.

## Remainder of class:

Create your draft GA Profile. Remember that once your GA Profile is live, it is visible to hiriring partners and recruiters. Be extra diligent with your spelling, grammar and attention to detail. 

The goal is to have your GA Profile be active and live as soon as possible, so use this time to create it.  Once you feel like you are ready to submit, have 3 peers review it.
