# Preparing for the Interview & Talking Money

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand what makes a successful interview + negotiation

* How to prepare for the interview

* How to present your unique story

* Know when to negotiate and talk money in the interview process

* Practicing interviewing + negotiation

## Framing: (5/5)

Everyone’s brand is different and unique; it is how you present yourself that matters. We all get nerves and feel self-conscious during interviews. The best way to combat this is to practice and be prepared!

Negotiating can be hard and intimidating. No matter how many times you have negotiated, how much money you have, or if you are an employer or job seeker - we are all weird about money! We’ll give you the tools and practice today to make this process less intimidating for you.

We do: (10/15)

**Open Discussion**

* What are you most concerned about in interview process?

* What are your perceptions going into an interview?  

* Does anyone have any stories to share?

* What would have made the interview better?

* What has been a great interview for you? A horrible one?

* Anyone interviewed someone and had a great or bad experience?

**Remember:**

This is not an interrogation! Success will come from creating connection and a real, authentic conversation.

**Best Practices: Mental Prep**

* Do your homework! Research the company and know the job.

* Practice telling your story and talking about your projects.

* List your top 5 skills (unique!)

    * For each skill, provide details about why this is a skill of yours

    * Give an example  

* Use the SEX approach:

    * **S**tatement

    * **E**xplanation

    * E**x**ample (1 or 2 examples to illustrate a skill)

* Have at least 3 professional stories ready to share (these can also be the examples for the skills - you can use these for answer to other questions)

    * Each story should have:

    * Beginning - situation, set the scene

    * Middle - what was the challenge, what did you do about it?

    * End- what were the results? Learnings? Benefits?

* Be yourself! Let your personality come through and be confident. You got this!

* This is a two-way street. You’re interviewing them as much as they’re interviewing you. Have questions to ask!

* This should be a dialogue, not an interrogation!

## Guided Practice: (10/25)

"Tell me about yourself." - This is an opportunity to channel our professional brands. We’ve all been working on defining our brands. This is your chance to put it into action. This is not an invitation to recite your entire life story or even to go bullet by bullet through your resume. Instead, it’s probably your first and best chance to pitch the hiring manager on why you’re the right one for the job. Consider this simple formula, [the Past-Present-Future formula](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-simple-formula-for-answering-tell-me-about-yourself).

Start with the present - where you are right now.

* What do you do?/What problem do you solve?

Segue into the past - a little about the experiences you’ve had and the skills you’ve gained.

* What makes you different?

Finish with the future - why you are really excited for this particular opportunity.

* Where are you going?/Why should we care?

**We do:** Volunteer interviews in front of class

(Volunteers from class answer question, students provide feedback)

* Did they tell a story?

* What was the opportunity?

* Was the opportunity met?

* What could they have done better?

## You do: Independent Practice (30/55)

Each student will take turns answering interview questions.

Turn to your neighbor. One of you will be the interviewer and one will be the interviewee.

Interviewers will ask the interviewee a minimum of 3 questions (10 minutes). Questions should include:

* Tell me about yourself.

* 2+ questions from [30 Behavioral Interview Questions You Should Be Ready to Answer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gtBdi394fuOdcnFOmpwapTmK2b8NfRFIzeq-vZs7geM/edit#heading=h.hhubctteg3x0)

The Interviewer will give feedback to the interviewee (5 minutes)

* As a group, they will share and discuss their feedback together and complete the [Peer Review Interview Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L1OP8HAgj6MZRJz2Z-Q_v79ATSBWeD_iQOlzuiPzoQo/edit#gid=1104109572).

After 15 min, we’ll switch roles.

## **10 min Break**

## Negotiations: Knowing your Worth (10/75)

55% of women and 39% of men admit being too scared to negotiate.

## I do: When do you talk money in the process?

* Very beginning: They may ask for your ideal salary. Appropriate responses:

    * I expect to be fairly compensated for the role and the salary

    * Give a 5-10K range, make sure your ideal salary is at the bottom of that range

* It may come up again right before getting an official offer. Be careful here. Often they ask because they want to give you an offer that you are going to accept. Make sure to say that you want to see everything in writing before accepting

* Negotiation process truly begins when you get a **written offer**. Wait until you have a written offer because that will give you full leverage

## You do: Change three things (10/85)

## The process of negotiating (5/90)

**Know your minimum number**

How much does it cost to live your life?

* Rent

* Debt

* Utilities

* Insurance

* Travel (car payment, metro)

* Food

* Savings / debt payment

* Other . . . the things that make your day to day nicer than not!

**Do your research**

Average salaries for GA graduates:

UX: $60 - $80K

WDI: $60 - $80K

DSI: $65K - $85K

Check Glassdoor, ask us, ask alumni, Google!

## We do (10/100)

Volunteer practice negotiating. Student volunteer will have just been offered a position, at 60K and they want 70K.

Class will provide feedback:

* Were they respectful, but strong?

* Did they present their value and give specific examples as to why they deserve more money?

* Did they approach the conversation looking for a win/win?

* Were they articulate, clear, and confident?

## You do: (20/120)

Turn to your neighbor. One of you will be the student and one will be the employer.

Students will practice negotiating for 10K more money. They’ve been offered 60K and they want 70K (5 minutes). Employers, your goal is to keep the number as low as possible, push back!

The employer will give feedback to the interviewee (5 minutes)

After 10 min, we’ll switch roles.

## We do: (5/125)

Open discussion - what worked/what didn’t. What do we need to practice moving forward?

## Homework 
Check your class calendar for your HW assingment due next Monday
