## I do: (10/30) 

**The secret six:**

1. Your resume should be an advertisement – not an autobiography

2. Write for the reader – not yourself

3. Make it easy to be screened in – not out

4. Tell them only what they want to hear

5. Give proof – not promises

6. One size does NOT fit all situations

Do your research - your resume is your personal advertisement

**The format:**

1. Introduction (centered): Name, phone number, email, location (just city, state), link to portfolio

2. Brand Statement (centered) {You do not need to label it as "Brand Statement"}

3. Skills (List your hard skills - tools, languages, programming)

4. Relevant Experience:

    1. General Assembly XX IMMERSIVE STUDENT + description

    2. Projects

    3. Any other experience related to web development, ux design, or data science

5. Professional Experience

    4. List chronologically

6. Education

    5. List GA again, but without a description

7. Side Hustle/hobbies/personal interests/awards (optional)

    6. Anything else that you are really proud of that you’d like to share

**Writing sucessful bullets:** 

- Begin with verbs (Developed, Created, Designed, Managed, Led), and be sure to vary them 

- [Be specific with your content ](http://everyvowel.com/resume-2/)

- Remember to provide proof...show the data. Don't just say "Led a team". Rather, "Led a team of five to achieve a growth rate that increased revenue 80%" 

## You do: (10/40) 

Turn to your neighbor. Choose a bullet on your resume to make quantifiable and brainstorm together on how to make it quantifiable and more specific

## Cover Letters  

Don't stress out about Cover Letters. This is another tool to gain insight into who you are as a candidate that should be an addition to your resume to demonstrate why you would be a great addition to their team.  

Use the KISS method-Keep It Simple Stupid. 

Format: 

Use the same heading as your resume {Name, phone number, email, location (just city, state), link to portfolio}

Paragraph 1: Say what you are applying for and how you heard about the organization. Make sure to include your thesis statement about why they should hire you and why you are the best fit for the organization 

Paragraph 2 + 3: Use these paragraphs to give specific examples to support your thesis statement. Do NOT just reiterate what's in your resume. Choose 2 stories to share that SHOW your strengths, rather than just telling them. 

Paragraph 4: Reiterate what you said in your first paragraph (highlight your overarching reasons why they should hire you) 

Paragraph 5: Call to Action and Contact Info. Avoid phrases like "Hope you will consider me" be confident and own it!

## LinkedIn: (20/60) 

LinkedIn is an incredibly valuable tool that can completely shift your networking strategies 

### Updating your LinkedIn 
First of all, turn off notifications when you are making lots of edits (Click your headshot > Settings + Privacy > Privacy tab > "Sharing Profile Edits" half way down the page)

Make sure your contact information is listed (Click on your headshot > scroll down halfway down the page on the righthand side "Contact and Personal Info" 

Update your tagline (under your name)
- Examples: Web Developer, Frontend Developer, Web Development Student at GA, User Experience Designer, Data Scientist. Even if you don't feel like it's true, put it up there! 

Once your resume is final, you can copy and paste the content into LinkedIn 

Add your GA projects to your GA section 
- Use the "Add a section to your GA Profile" and then look for "Projects" 

Ask for recommendations: former bosses, coworkers, clients 
- You can use the [recommendation section on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/96/request-a-recommendation?lang=en) and be sure to also follow up with a personalized note:

I'll soon be job searching and am looking to build up my LinkedIn profile, would you be willing to write me a recommendation? I'd be happy to draft some ideas for you if that's helpful. 

Find your career crushes and ask them to coffee.
- Hi Name! I'm a current ABC student at GA and I'm looking to learn more about the tech field in DC. I was really impressed by your career path and would love to pick your brain. Would you be open to coffee (my treat) or quick phone call in the next couple of weeks? 

Whenever you are interested in an organization, search to see if you have any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree connections to that organization, and then ask for a connection
